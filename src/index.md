## Blyth is a toolkit, not a framework.

Blyth is a handy toolkit, CLI and utility for HTML/CSS programmers who like [design tokens](/docs/tokens/) and [utilities](/docs/utilities/).

It allows developers to structure, organise and scale their CSS in a platform agnostic way. It doesn't express opinions on how your CSS should be structured, or whether you want to use BEM, or a utility-first approach.

Please note: these are brand new docs, and we're more than happy to accept PR's.

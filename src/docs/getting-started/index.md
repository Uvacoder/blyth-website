## Getting Started

Blyth CSS is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blyth-css) and requires version 8 of Node.js or higher.

### Installing Blyth into an existing repository

#### Install Blyth CLI

Install Blyth globally by running:

```bash
npm install @bly-th/css@alpha -g
```

This will install Blyth CLI globally, so you can run `blyth` commands from any directory.

#### Add project config to package.json

Blyth is versatile in it's situation. In theory, it can run in any project and can be adapted to suit _your_ workflow.

To get us started, add the following lines to your package.json:

```json
  "blyth": {
    "tokensOutputPath": "css/tokens.css",
    "utilityOutputPath": "css/utility"
  },
```

The `blyth` config will allow you to specify where you want Blyth to output generated CSS.

Congratulations â€” you're now ready to go with Blyth!
